I am a Statistics student specializing in the applications of the Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence to the real world business problems. Well, I don't think I can get a Data Science job without using these crispy words(Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence). Fun apart, This blog is for those who are in the very beginning stage of learning Data Science and getting frustrated of the confusing study material in MOOCs these days.
